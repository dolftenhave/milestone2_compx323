# Data Generation App

This application is designed to generate large amounts of csv data.

## parseArgs

This program generates a pre defined table that will be used by MakeCSV to generate a bunch of random csv data

#### Usage

`parseArgs <table name> <arguments>`

There are several different type of arguments used to greate the data

- **varchar** `-v <length>` legnth 1 to n.
- **integer** `-i <length>` lengtth 0 will auto increment starting form 1. A fixed lenth will generate a random number with that many digits *e.g. 2 will generate a number 10-99*
- **date** `-d` will generate a random date in the format DD/MM/YYYY
- **time** `-t` will generate a random time
- **file** `-f <path to file> <column to choose the data from>` will take data from a specified column of another csv file and insert it into this column. This is used in instances of foreign keys.
- **double** `-o <length> <delimiter position>` will generate a dounle with the length and position of the delimiter.
- **sequential int** `-I <staring number>` will generate a sequential integer for each line
- **sequntial varchar** `-V <length>` will generate sequential varchar character for each line. Starting with *AAAA, AAAB, AAAC, ... , zzzz*. This will be done based on the ascii value of the letters.
- **sequential file** `-F <path to file> <column to choose from>` Will take data from the file starting from the top of the file untill the end. It will loop if the end is reached.

*Note:* Sequential data type are a good use when generating unique data or when you want to ensure that every case in a file is used at least once.

## MakeCSV

This program will generate lines of CSV data in the pattern layed in a table file that is generated by parseAegs.

usage `java MakeCSV <n-lines> <path/to/table/file> <optional, output name>`

*Both parseArgs & MakeCSV were created by Dolf ten Have for Compx323-25A*

The header of the table file has the following structure:<br />
`<num rows> <num fileRefs> <num seq varchars> <max seq varchar len> <num seq fileRefs>`
